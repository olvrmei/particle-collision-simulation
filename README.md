This is a short project I made for my physics 2 class. The simulation contains spheres(particles) inside a box that collide with each other ~~with the principles of said physics things~~. 
## :space_invader: How to run the code
Under construction...
## :hammer: How I made it
Written in python using the library [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/ "Pygame").
